I‚Äôm a graduate student in the Petroff lab at MSU and the author/maintaner of the open source [tidyNano package](https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/).  I provide all the code and data to all my blogposts where I explore interesting datasets using a variety of different tools. When I‚Äôm not in the lab, I enjoy cooking, photography, and reading. #rstats üìà‚ôüÔ∏èü•ò   

  
This site was made with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),  and  deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All the data and code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/nguyens7/website).  If you find my blog useful, [you can buy me a ‚òïÔ∏è on Ko-fi.](https://ko-fi.com/O4O71BDFZ)
